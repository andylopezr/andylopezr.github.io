# HTML Email

This project is an HTML email template. It's designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Structure

The email is structured using HTML tables for maximum compatibility with email clients. Each item in the email (consisting of an image and two paragraphs) is wrapped in a `td` element.

## Styles

Styles are applied inline for maximum compatibility with email clients. The email uses a combination of images and text, all of which are centered using CSS flexbox.

## Responsiveness

The email is designed to be responsive. When the viewport is 640 pixels or less, the items are organized into one column for easy viewing on mobile devices. This is achieved using a CSS media query.

## Links

The email contains clickable images that lead to various websites. These images are wrapped in `a` tags, and the `target="_blank"` attribute is used to make the links open in a new tab.

## Padding and Margins

Padding and margins are used to create space around the items in the email. Different padding and margin values are used for the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the items.

## Colors

The text color is set to white for maximum contrast with the background color.

## How to Use

To use this email template, simply replace the placeholder content with your own content. Be sure to update the URLs for the clickable images to point to your own websites.
